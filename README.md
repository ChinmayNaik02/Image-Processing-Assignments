## Overview
The assignments in this repository focus on the fundamental concepts of image processing. Each assignment covers essential topics such as color models, Gaussian and Sobel filters, histogram equalization, and histogram specification. These exercises aim to provide a solid understanding of the basic techniques used in image processing, which are crucial for more advanced studies in computer vision.


## Assignments
1. [Assignment 1](Assignment-1.ipynb): Basics of colour models and conversion
2. [Assignment 2](Assignment-2.ipynb): Gaussian and Sobel filters
3. [Assignment 3](Assignment-3.ipynb): Histogram Equalization and Specification

## Installation
To run the notebooks locally, you'll need to set up your Python environment with the necessary libraries. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Computer-Vision-Assignments.git
    cd Computer-Vision-Assignments
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. After setting up the environment, you can run the Jupyter Notebooks using the following command:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a web browser where you can navigate to the assignment files and run the code cells.
